# Leaflet Geometry Management
A Leaflet Plugin For Creating And Editing Geometry Layers in Leaflet 1.0.  
Draw, Edit, Drag, and Snap Features.

In the name "leaflet.pm" the "pm" stands for Polygon Management. At the time, this plugin only supported polygons. Now you can edit Markers, Polylines, Polygons, LayerGroups, GeoJSON and more are coming.

### Why *another* geometry editing plugin?
As leaflet.draw development seemed to came to a halt and I needed support for leaflet 1.0 I created this plugin myself due to a lack of alternatives.  
As we are always using the latest leaflet version in a big production app, I will (have to) keep this plugin constantly developed.

## [Demo](http://leaflet.pm.kaumgeschlafen.com/)

### Getting Started

#### Install via npm
`npm install leaflet.pm --save`

#### Install via Bower
`bower install leaflet.pm --save`

#### Install Manually
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/codeofsumit/leaflet.pm/releases). Include `leaflet.pm.min.js` and `leaflet.pm.css` in your project.


#### Include via CDN
CSS
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet.pm@0.13.0/dist/leaflet.pm.css" />`

JS
`<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet.pm@0.13.0/dist/leaflet.pm.min.js"></script>`

#### Include as ES6 Module
`import 'leaflet.pm';`  
`import 'leaflet.pm/dist/leaflet.pm.css';`

#### Include as CommonJS Module
`require('leaflet.pm');`  
`require('leaflet.pm/dist/leaflet.pm.css');`


#### Init Leaflet.PM
Just include `leaflet.pm.min.js` right after Leaflet. It initializes itself.


##### Leaflet.PM Toolbar
This plugin comes with an optional toolbar to give you buttons to use the various features.

```
// define toolbar options
var options = {
    position: 'topleft', // toolbar position, options are 'topleft', 'topright', 'bottomleft', 'bottomright'
    drawMarker: true,  // adds button to draw markers
    drawPolygon: true,  // adds button to draw a polygon
    drawPolyline: true,  // adds button to draw a polyline
    editPolygon: true,  // adds button to toggle global edit mode
    deleteLayer: true   // adds a button to delete layers
};

// add leaflet.pm controls to the map
map.pm.addControls(options);
```
If no options are passed, all buttons will be shown.


##### Drawing Mode
Use Drawing Mode on a map like this


```

// optional options for line style during draw. These are the defaults
var options = {
    // the lines between coordinates/markers
    templineStyle: {
        color: 'red',
    },

    // the line from the last marker to the mouse cursor
    hintlineStyle: {
        color: 'red',
        dashArray: [5, 5],
    },
};

// enable drawing mode for shape - e.g. Poly or Line
map.pm.enableDraw('Poly', options);
map.pm.enableDraw('Line', options);
map.pm.enableDraw('Marker', options);

// get array of all available shapes (currently Poly and Line)
map.pm.Draw.getShapes()

// listen to when drawing mode gets enabled
map.on('pm:drawstart', function(e) {//...});


// disable drawing mode
map.pm.disableDraw('Poly');

// listen to when drawing mode gets disabled
map.on('pm:drawend', function(e) {//...});

// listen to when a new layer is created
map.on('pm:create', function(e) {//...});

```


##### Edit Mode
Use Edit Mode for a layer like this:

```
var polygonLayer = L.geoJson(data).addTo(map);

// optional options
var options = {

    // makes the layer draggable
    draggable: true,

    // makes the vertices snappable to other layers
    // temporarily disable snapping during drag by pressing ALT
    snappable: true,

    // distance in pixels that needs to be undercut to trigger snapping
    // default: 30
    snapDistance: 30

};

// enable edit mode
polygonLayer.pm.enable(options);
marker.pm.enable(options);

// disable edit mode
polygonLayer.pm.disable();

// toggle edit mode
polygonLayer.pm.toggleEdit(options);

// check if edit mode is enabled
polygonLayer.pm.enabled(); // returns true/false

// listen to changes
polygonLayer.on('pm:edit', function(e) {//...});
polygonLayer.on('pm:dragstart', function(e) {//...});
polygonLayer.on('pm:drag', function(e) {//...});
polygonLayer.on('pm:dragend', function(e) {//...});

// listen to when a marker of a polygon-vertex is being dragged
polygonLayer.on('pm:markerdragstart', function(e) {//...});
polygonLayer.on('pm:markerdragend', function(e) {//...});

// listen to when snapping occurs
// pm:snap and pm:unsnap are, in addition to the layer, also fired on the markers of the polygon
// if you'd need it for some advanced behaviour
polygonLayer.on('pm:snap', function(e) {//...});
polygonLayer.on('pm:unsnap', function(e) {//...});

```


### Customize Style

In order to change the style of the lines during draw, pass these options to the `enableDraw()` function.

```
// optional options for line style during draw. These are the defaults
var options = {
    // the lines between coordinates/markers
    templineStyle: {
        color: 'red',
    },

    // the line from the last marker to the mouse cursor
    hintlineStyle: {
        color: 'red',
        dashArray: [5, 5],
    },
};

// enable drawing mode for shape - e.g. Poly or Line
map.pm.enableDraw('Poly', options);
```

To customize the style of the drawn layer (polygon, polyline) with leaflets options, you can either pass the options to `enableDraw` as well:

```
// optional options for line style during draw. These are the defaults
var options = {
    templineStyle: {},
    hintlineStyle: {},
    pathOptions: {
        // add leaflet options for polylines/polygons
        color: 'orange',
        fillColor: 'green',
    }
};

// enable drawing mode for shape - e.g. Poly or Line
map.pm.enableDraw('Poly', options);
```

or set the options generally:

```
map.pm.setPathOptions({
    color: 'orange',
    fillColor: 'green',
    fillOpacity: 0.4,
});
```


### Credit
As I never built a leaflet plugin before, I looked heavily into the code of leaflet.draw to find out how to do stuff. So don't be surprised to see some familiar code.

The icons used for the toolbar are CC-BY [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/).

I also took a hard look at the great [L.GeometryUtil](https://github.com/makinacorpus/Leaflet.GeometryUtil) for some of my helper functions.
